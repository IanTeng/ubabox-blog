Learning the differences between them, would enable Lenovo to develop and deliver the right message to the right users, ultimately converting non-purchasing users into purchasers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###SOLUTION\r\n\r\nThe Clicktale and Adobe Analytics integration enables Lenovo to leverage their existing investments by visualizing the in-page behavior of each segment. The integration combines the best the two solutions have to offer - Clicktale’s rich visualization layer and Adobe Analytics’ powerful segmentation capabilities - to provide even more insights into users’ digital psychology. Additionally, Lenovo can drill down to view individual visitor browsing sessions as well as aggregated heatmaps - all directly from within the Adobe Analytics UI.\r\n\r\nClicktale’s heatmaps and session replays revealed an interesting difference between the purchasers and the non-purchasers. While purchasers heavily used the manual search and top navigation bar on the homepage, non-purchasers scarcely used the navigation bar and focused on the country change instead. Additionally, while purchasers were drawn to the main homepage banner and deals, nonpurchasers avoided the banner and were less focused on their search.\r\n\r\n###Lenovo.com homepage - Clicktale Heatmaps\r\n\r\nAs for the product pages, Clicktale’s heatmaps and session replays revealed a similar behavior pattern. Purchasers were heavily focused on the areas they were interested in, using the filters to do so. The non- purchasers, on the other hand, were much less focused, clicking on product images rather than filters.\r\n\r\n###CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nUsing the integration and isolating the segments, Lenovo were able to clearly define the differences between the two user segments and better understand their online experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nLenovo.com purchasers are focused and their path is clear within the Adobe Analytics tool. They are goal oriented and do not need much guidance in their online journey. On the other hand, the non-purchasers are volatile. They are less focused in their search, they need to be engaged with and guided through the funnel, favoring product images and videos over text.\r\n\r\nClicktale’s Web Psychologists, Dr. Liraz Margalit, explains the findings: “When surfing the web, there are two cognitive routes activated for processing information - central and peripheral. Each route is activated according to the user’s intention. Lenovo.com purchasers, for example, use the central route; they are goal oriented and devote more cognitive resources into finding exactly what they are looking for. Non-purchasers, on the other hand, use the peripheral route; they browse the site and are easily drawn to colorful images.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the non-purchasers dominate a significant percentage of Lenovo website user base, better understanding their customer experience was crucial towards improving it and increasing conversion rates. The further Lenovo could understand non-purchasers, the more they could influence their behavior and decision to purchase online.\r\n### 联系我们\r\nubabox.com",
